# JS-Tile-Master-Helper
This is HTML and js code for a tile calculator that calculates either the area or volume of a rectangular tile. The calculator has two checkboxes, one for area and one for volume, and allows the user to input the length, width and height (if the volume checkbox is checked) of the tile. When the user clicks the "Calculate" button, the calculator will use the user-inputted values and either calculate the area (if the area checkbox is checked) or the volume (if the volume checkbox is checked) and display the result in the text box. The result will be in cubic meters.
